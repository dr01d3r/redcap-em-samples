## Plugin - Basic

A basic module that has the core components for displaying a plugin page within the scope of a project.

- minimal `config.json` configuration
  - simple project link
  - no project settings
- add a method to the module class to output html to the page
  - in this case, we will output 'debug' data that has worked well for me and my team 
- display a little html when the plugin loads
